# Data Science Portfolio
By: Carlos Brown

The following are a selection of projects I have completed that showcase my skill in Python Programming, Data Visualization, Statistical Methods, and Machine Learning. I hope you find them interesting and useful as I did.

### Projects

**Predicting Bridge Conditions in Georgia.** Using a subset of selected features from the FHWA Bridge Inventory to predict the current condition of a highway bridge in the state. Utilizes both Regression and Classification models for prediction. Includes extensive visualization and some hypothesis testing as well.

**Fake News Detection using Google BERT.** Predict whether a news article is fake news or real news from the article text using Naive Bayes and the Google BERT algorithm. Identify relevant attributes of both fake and real news. Test the fit of the text to the Zipf distibution.

**Stock Normality** Answering the question, do publicly traded stock prices move according to the normal distribution? Uses hypothesis testing, in particluar the Anderson-Darling test.
